This month, Jérémie, Gaëtan and Just took a trip to Nancy (France), to participate in the [Automatic Type Design symposium](https://automatic-type-design.anrt-nancy.fr/colloques/automatic-type-design-3) organized by [ANRT](https://anrt-nancy.fr/en).

We led two one-day Fontra workshops, each with about 20 participants, using our internal collaborative Fontra server. The participants were a mix of international students and professionals, with very diverse backgrounds. They got to learn the basics of creating variable fonts with Fontra, while working collaborative in small groups. We especially encouraged them to use variable components.

The following two days were packed with very inspriring talks. Several talks focussed on algorithmic type design, and/or experimental approaches to drawing digital letters.

The last day of the symposium was dedicated to a series of demos. We got to do a compact Fontra demo, where we talked about the ideas behind Fontra, and showcased the core set of features. We were happy to answer some good questions from the audience.

### Fontra updates

The font sources panel got a redesign: the old design was too hard to extend. The first thing that was added was settings for global guidelines. Previously, Fontra only supported per-glyph guidelines, but with this new feature we added support for global guidelines.

Additionally, many smaller bugs and user experience issues were fixed. For a complete list, please have a look at the [list of recent changes](https://fontra.xyz/changelog.html).
